1. If you want to change the logo of your site then create logo.svg and put it into the root folder of your theme"myth"

```html
	-theme
		-myth
			logo.svg
```

Drupal 8 only will automatically load that logo for your site. By default drupal 8 support "svg" for logo.

a) To use "logo.png" or something else, you need to add custom settings definition in your theme. To do this, add the following lines to  theme/myth/config/install/myth.settings.yml file in your theme folder. After doing this, you must reinstall your theme if already installed.

myth.settings.yml
-----------------
```yml
logo:
  path: 'themes/custom/myth/logo.png'
  use_default: false
```
