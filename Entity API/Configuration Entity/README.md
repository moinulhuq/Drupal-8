Defining a configuration entity type is somewhat similar to defining a content entity type. The configuration has a proper Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) process that can be managed. Configuration entities are not fieldable. All the attributes of a configuration entity are defined in its configuration schema definition.
